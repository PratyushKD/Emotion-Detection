# __Emotion Detection using CNNs and FER-2013__
A deep learning-based system to classify human facial emotions from grayscale images into seven categories using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## __Project Description__
- Built a deep learning model to classify facial expressions into 7 categories using grayscale images from the FER-2013 dataset.
- Addressed class imbalance using data augmentation techniques and class weighting during training.
- Designed custom CNN models and experimented with advanced architectures like VGG16 and ResNet50V2.
- Achieved 64% accuracy with ResNet50V2, evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
- Deployed the final model using Gradio and OpenCV to perform real-time emotion detection from webcam input.
