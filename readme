# __Emotion Detection using CNNs and FER-2013__
A deep learning-based system to classify human facial emotions from grayscale images into seven categories using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## __Project Description__
This project aims to automatically detect facial emotions using a neural network model trained on the FER-2013 dataset. It classifies 48x48 grayscale face images into seven emotion classes: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral.

The project showcases:
-A custom CNN model designed from scratch
-Transfer learning using VGG and ResNet architectures
-Visualizations, performance metrics, and prediction outputs

This work is relevant for applications in mental health monitoring, user experience tracking, human-computer interaction, and surveillance systems.
