# Emotion Detection Project 🎭

Facial emotion classification using Convolutional Neural Networks and the FER-2013 dataset.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This notebook demonstrates how to use deep learning models (CNNs) for detecting emotions from grayscale facial images (48x48 pixels). The goal is to classify expressions into 7 categories:  
**Angry**, **Disgust**, **Fear**, **Happy**, **Sad**, **Surprise**, and **Neutral**.
